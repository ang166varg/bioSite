			<p>
			David Perez is a creative storyteller whose passions for art, family, and culture are deeply connected to his roots. He was born and raised in the Inland Empire, with family ties across California, where he grew up surrounded by stores, movies, and traditions that shaped his imagination and inevitably who he is as a person. Now living in Colorado with his girlfriend, Angela, he continues to carry that foundation of his family, his creativity, and his culture into everything he does. 
			Drawing and storytelling have always been at the center of David‚Äôs life from sketching characters to building entire worlds, his artwork often draws inspiration from his Mexican American heritage. His comic book progress, center on Aztec American Fictional characters journeying through old Mexico, reflecting his love for blending history, culture, and adventure, into unique stories. He finds similar inspirations in books that he likes reading such as Burro Genuis by Victore Villasenor, which reminds him of his family roots, and in films like The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and even lighthearted movies such as Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. 
			For David, creativity does not stand alone since it always ties back to the people he cares and loves for. Whether rewatching favorite movies with his family, sharing new sketches with his girlfriend, Angela, or remembering the support he received growing up in California, those connections motivate him daily. It also motivates his goals in which reflect that same spirit: finishing his comic book, buying a home one day where his family and friends feel welcome, and traveling to Florence, Italy, to experience the art and architecture he has admired for years. 
			At his core, David is someone who never forgets where he comes from, and who finds joy in transforming stories, art and family experiences into lasting memories.
